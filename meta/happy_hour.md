# Happy Hours at Artsy

Happy Hours are a long-standing event at Artsy where employees get together with our partners, artists and fellow engineers.

It's held inside our offices, on a weekly basis. We strive to make them full of people across the tech/arts spectrum. 

There are small snacks, drinks ranging from beer to wine.
